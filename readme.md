## üéõÔ∏è Gig Performer 5 Integration

The foot controller works in tandem with Gig Performer 5 to create a bidirectional control system:



1. **Button Press Flow**
   - Physical button press sends MIDI message
   - GP5 receives and mirrors the button state
   - GP5 triggers the corresponding plugin parameter
   - GP5 sends feedback to control LED states

2. **Current Setup**
   - Modified version of NDSP Archetype Cory Wong preset
   - Bidirectional MIDI feedback for accurate LED states
   - Custom rackspaces for different song sections
   - Real-time visual feedback via HDMI display

3. **Control Mapping**
   - Each footswitch is mapped to corresponding GP5 widgets
   - LED states reflect actual plugin parameters
   - BPM sync between controller and GP5
   - Instant preset switching for live performance

{2, Green}       // RGB(63, 210, 63)
{3, Yellow}      // RGB(200, 200, 56)
{4, White}       // RGB(91, 119, 256)
{5, Light Blue}  // RGB(0, 256, 179)
{6, Light Green} // RGB(68, 256, 68)
```

### Detailed Signal Path

1. **Input Flow**
   - ESP32 sends MIDI messages via Bluetooth LE
   - MidiBerry receives BLE MIDI signals
   - LoopMIDI creates virtual MIDI port
   - Gig Performer 5 receives MIDI through virtual port

2. **Output Flow**
   - Gig Performer 5 sends MIDI feedback
   - LoopMIDI routes signals to MidiSYNTHBerry
   - MidiSYNTHBerry sends BLE MIDI back to ESP32
   - ESP32 updates LED states based on received signals

- 2000ms long-press threshold

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Current Limitations

- To use this controller with MIDI-compatible guitar pedals or multi-effects units, you'll need a BLE MIDI-capable device (like a computer running MidiBerry) to act as a bridge between the controller and your MIDI hardware
- Direct connection to traditional MIDI hardware is not yet supported
- Integration with [MIDI_FOOT_UI](https://github.com/bielaltoe/MIDI_FOOT_UI) is planned for future releases and will include:
  - Direct MIDI hardware connectivity
  - Standalone operation without a computer
